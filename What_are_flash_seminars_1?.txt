What are flash seminars?

Flash Seminars are one-time discussions that bring together small groups of people to explore thought-provoking topics in a way that is both imaginative and welcoming. Each Flash Seminar is led by a facilitator with experience in the topic and a passion for informed and open discussion. Flash Seminars make learning in cities more creative, inclusive and fun!
